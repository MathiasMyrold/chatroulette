Heroku.yml if we are running server and klient seperately:
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: ./klient
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
  socket: 
    build: 
      context: ./web_server
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

Then you also have to change the websocket path in the Chat.js file.
